## Single page application with Node and Angular

Today we will be creating a very simple Todo application using the MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node) stack. We will be creating:
+ SPA - Single page application
+ Storing todo in mongodb using Mongoose
+ Using Express frameword
+ Creating resful  node API
+ Using Angular for the fontend and to access the API.


#### To run:
`node server`

> Automatically restart server when files change: By default, node will not monitor for file changes after your server has been started. This means youâ€™d have to shut down and start the server every time you made a file change. This can be fixed with nodemon. To use: install nodemon globally `npm install -g nodemon`. Start your server with `nodemon server.js` now. Smooth sailing from there.
